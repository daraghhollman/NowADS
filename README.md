# NowADS
I want to learn new things everyday, not nescessarily in my own field. This script searches NASA ADS for recent top papers matching search critera and selects one at random for you to read.

## Set-up
To use the script you require an API token for accessing NASA ADS. Create a file in the repository directory called "token.txt".

Create a token via the [API help page](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/api/) and paste this into your token file.
